# ShipmentSure: Predicting On-Time Delivery Using Supplier Data

## Project Overview (Work in Progress - Data Collection Phase)

This repository currently holds the collected dataset for the **"ShipmentSure: Predicting On-Time Delivery Using Supplier Data"** project. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict whether a shipment will be delivered on time, based on various supplier-related data points. Early prediction can significantly improve logistics, inventory management, and customer satisfaction.


## Dataset

The dataset for this project includes various attributes related to supplier performance and shipment characteristics that influence delivery timeliness.

## Project Goals (Future Phases)

Upon completion of the data collection phase, the project will proceed with:
1.  **Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Cleaning, transforming, and understanding the dataset's characteristics.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features to enhance model performance.
3.  **Model Selection and Training:** Experimenting with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to build a predictive model.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
5.  **Deployment (Optional):** Developing a simple application or API for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Expected to Be Used

*   Python
*   Pandas (for data manipulation)
*   NumPy (for numerical operations)
*   Scikit-learn (for machine learning models)
*   Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
